# Push-Notification-System API Services

- It is a typical Spring boot project with Swagger UI configure. 
- You can clone the project and import as maven project. 
- You have to update the MySQL and MongoDB credentials as per yours in the application.properties file. 
- And also you have to modify the OneSignal APP_ID and REST_API_KEY in the same properties file. 
- Once modifying these things you simply run the project as same as any Spring Boot application. 
- You can find the list of APIs with descriptions at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/
